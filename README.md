# 🌟 My JavaScript Learning Journey

Hey there! I'm Diana, and this README is a reflection of my hands-on learning journey with JavaScript — from the very basics to deeper concepts like callbacks and arrow functions. As a kinesthetic learner (ISTJ in the house 🙋🏾‍♀️), I learn best by *doing*, and this document is proof of the sweat and syntax!

## ✨ Topics I've Covered So Far

### 🔹 1. JavaScript Basics
- JavaScript Syntax (statements, comments, semicolons)
- Variables (`let`, `const`, `var`)
- Data Types (primitive vs non-primitive)
- Operators (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical)

### 🔹 2. Control Structures
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)
- Loop controls: `break`, `continue`

### 🔹 3. Functions
- Function Declarations & Expressions
- Parameters vs Arguments
- Return values
- Arrow functions (`=>`)
- Scope (briefly touched)

### 🔹 4. Methods vs Functions
- Difference between a method and a standalone function
- Using object methods (`object.method()`)

### 🔹 5. Callback Functions
- What a callback is and why it's useful
- Real-world analogy (pizza delivery 🙌🏾)
- Usage with `setTimeout()` and custom functions

### 🔹 6. Array Methods
- `.forEach()` for looping through arrays
- Parameters inside `.forEach()` (value, index)

## 🧠 Key Concepts I've Locked In

- **Functions are reusable blocks of code** — they help me avoid repeating myself.
- **Arrow functions** = shorter, cleaner syntax (and I'm loving them 🏹).
- **Callbacks** are functions passed into other functions — great for waiting on stuff or customizing behavior.
- **Methods live inside objects**, while functions stand alone.
- **Loops + arrays** = powerful combo for working with multiple items.

## 💬 Note to Self

> “Allow yourself to be a beginner. No one starts off being excellent.”  
> – Me, reminding myself that growth > perfection 🌱

## 📍Tools I'm Using

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Live Server extension
- Google Chrome DevTools
- ChatGPT (a.k.a. Keke 💕) for explanations & code reviews

## 🚀 Let's Keep Going

This journey is just beginning, but the foundation is solid.  
If you're reading this, and you're just starting out too — **trust me, it gets easier** the more you *do*.

Stay curious, stay consistent.
